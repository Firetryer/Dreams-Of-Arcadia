# DreamsOfArcadia

	(Name is a work in progress)

This is my submission for the [Github Annual Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2017).  

Its going to be a point and click adventure game, that isn't just a point and click adventure game(what?!). The mechanics will involve our fateful hero going through adventures, where the way to solve the problems he faces are through old school arcade-style minigames!


As of right now, theres no screenshot to show yet, as I'm still working on the backend. For possible updates, check out my [twitter](https://twitter.com/rewelcabiles).


### Things being used to make this:

 * Python 3
 * Pygame
